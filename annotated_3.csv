This activity involves the establishment of transparent and effective rules for the promotion of a competitive and efficient integrated European energy market, as required by the Third Energy Package. Furthermore, as in previous years, the Authority continued to provide impetus to its own international commitment, maintaining its dialogue and multilateral and bilateral institutional cooperation, to promote the harmonisation of European rules with those of countries that, although not part of the European Union, are important interlocutors in the energy sector. In particular, it promoted actions to strengthen its role as a key regulator in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean basin, which represent geographical areas of prime importance for the Italian energy system.","NRA Report","Italy",2017-01-01,0,2017,NA,21713,"ACER CEER ENTSO","Regulators","Southern Europe",NA,0,FALSE,"liberal_institutions"

The main factor fuelling this rapid gas consumption growth is the prevailing heavily subsidized domestic gas price.

Instead, noncontroversial, ineffective, or badly prepared alternatives were proposed to manage natural gas use. Notably, the very slow development of a renewable energy program to reduce the use of natural gas while, at the same time, a significant build-up of gas-fired power capacity is already under way.

Adding to this are the structural and cyclical shifts in international oil and gas markets which have ended up undermining Sonatrachs marketing strategies. In a context where natural gas buyers are resolutely seeking to shorten their long-term contracts, increase the flexibility of quantities they purchase and adjust pricing formulae to reflect competitive market conditions, we have focused on the latest round of contract re-negotiations and price reviews to try and learn what new trade patterns and relationships the resulting adjustments could reveal. Whatever these might be, they are likely to have been influenced by the realization that Sonatrach is increasingly being perceived as structurally short on gas supply. Looking ahead, we have challengingly assumed that gas production will be stagnating at best. Therefore, in a moderate demand scenario, Algeria would be left with only 15 bcm/year to export by 2030. In a lower production or high demand scenarios, it will cease exporting all together, therefore importing gas beyond any such a point. With this conceivable perspective, policymakers should consider shifting their focus away from commodity trade, as the foremost way to monetize Algerias gas resources and ponder a different energy/industrial strategy. Renegotiations of Sonatrachs gas contracts should reflect this alternative perspective. Instead of uncertain quid pro quos they are no longer in a position to ask for, Sonatrach and its governing policymakers should create ground for new win-win situations and partnerships in all areas of hydrocarbon development activities. Such a course of action may stand a better chance of success in reversing the troubling trends we have duly highlighted and creating more diversified value for Algerias future.","OIES",NA,2016-05-01,1,2016,"Algerian Gas Troubling Trends, Troubled Policies",38495,"Algerian gas","Thinktanks","Other",NA,0,FALSE,"realist_objectives"

The UK is currently unique among major European gas markets in having very little underground storage capacity, no supply or stockholding obligations on importers, shippers and suppliers and no publicly-funded or strategic gas stocks11 . The risks to which UK consumers have become exposed by this unbalanced pattern of gas supply and dependence on uncontracted LNG suddenly became apparent only in 2021-22.","OIES",NA,2023-05-01,0,2023,"LNG and UK Energy Security",51704,"Balancing","Thinktanks","Other",NA,1,FALSE,"liberal_framework"

The actions envisaged notably include the management of the mapping of the supply relationship between balancing users and distribution users. In fact, a system is considered to be more efficient when it unequivocally allocates the withdrawals of each end customer to a balancing user. The reform is made possible by the use of the Integrated Information System (SII) as an instrument for certifying commercial relations between balancing users, distribution users and connected customers. The reform has also proposed the modification of the procedures for the conferral of transport capacity at the point of redelivery of the transport network with the distribution networks and the corresponding output points.

Import demand declines progressively from about 45 bcm in 2021 to about 15 bcm in 2050 and the degree of import dependence rises gradually from about 55% to 85% in 2050. Since some sources of LNG are among the lowest-cost suppliers of gas to NW Europe, and it is currently unlikely that large-scale Russian pipeline supply to Europe will resume, LNG is expected to make up a significant but fluctuating share of UK gas imports for the foreseeable future. These projections of future annual gas demand and supply do not capture an essential element in the intended decarbonisation of the UK economy, namely the provision of seasonal, daily and intra-day flexibility. Natural gas has been for decades the default marginal fuel in the UK economy, meeting any unexpected fluctuations in the demand for energy in heating and electricity generation arising from economic cycles, demand shocks and weather events and, increasingly, providing the flexibility in electricity generation to meet the variations in wind and solar output as more intermittent low-carbon capacity is connected to the grid. In other words, natural gas provides the back-up and flexibility demanded by UK consumers both in annual energy balances and in half-hourly electricity wholesale markets. If UK decarbonisation is to proceed at the intended pace and at acceptable cost, natural gas will have to continue to provide this source of flexible supply until economic low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen or battery storage are deployed at sufficient scale. Therefore, at present, only natural gas can ensure a smooth and affordable UK energy transition. Ensuring a secure and affordable supply of gas to the UK wholesale market must underpin this ambitious transition.","OIES",NA,2023-05-01,0,2023,"LNG and UK Energy Security",51699,"Climate & Energy","Thinktanks","Other",NA,0,TRUE,"realist_framework"

For households with a variable price, on the other hand, the most popular options are the 100% green offer guarantee (8.8%) and the ancillary energy services (5%); even for these customers, the contract without additional services shows one of the highest prices, surpassed only by the ancillary energy services and the provision of other products or services offered together with gas.

Indeed, historically the UK maintained low gas storage which has not been a problem so long as North Sea production capacity could provide flexibility. But now the deal is different. LNG imports are less secure than domestic supplies, and it may take too much time for the price developments to incentivize the flexible LNG shipments to come to the rescue in case of gas shortage.

These two countries use a lot of gas to generate their electricity, as well as in the final energy consumption of their residential sectors, which for the most part concerns the heating of houses. This larger role for gas can generally be observed as well in those countries which are well-connected to the Dutch and British gas infrastructure networks. 9 Other countries, however, attribute a much smaller role to gas, mostly being confined to one specific energy consumption sector or used as industrial feedstock.

Fuel wood (and lignite) from retail market are typically burned in very low efficiency stoves that require significant fuel stocks. Exposed to cold periods, consumers choose between depleting stock with the risk of adequacy to the end of the winter, buying on the open (or grey) market at inflated prices or supplementing with electricity. Default in paying electricity bills during a winter is not likely to result in disconnection. During cold periods, the marginal cost of fuel wood increases while the marginal cost of electricity actually decreases and consumers top up with electricity. IEA (2012), Energy in the Western Balkans, 2008 as well as the World Bank, Stock taking report on energy efficiency in the Western Balkans, 2010 (https://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/664179.PDF) demonstrate this pattern while Silva and others (http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en//pdf/wps4127.pdf) demonstrates the correlation between electricity and fuel wood pricing. During cold periods, cash constrained district heating systems are likely to limit deliveries of heat that prompts their customers to supplement this with electricity. Increased electricity load over distribution grids causes a disproportional increase in network losses that further contributes to a spike in electricity demand.

Industrial consumers are obliged to buy their electricity from the wholesale electricity and capacity market (WECM) at a price set by the market, which is higher than the regulated tariffs for residential consumers.

Nevertheless, homeworking in Europe has already flattened daily power demand and adjusted the balance between morning to afternoon, and if physical return to offices remains restricted, winter residential demand could increase significantly. In Europe and the US, installation of greener heating and cooling devices (heat pumps, rooftop solar, home storage systems, micro-CHP, renewable hydrogen) and all forms of efficiency improvements are likely. Some of these will need financial support from government or regulators and if implemented on a large scale would probably require a longer timescale than five years.

In the short term, gas may benefit if there are connections to the network, but longer-term benefits will be for renewables. In Russia, gas demand may not be greatly impacted but non-payment is increasing, which will result in falling cash revenues for gas companies. In China, home working will mean marginally more gas use, but price competitiveness with coal will likely be more important.

Most importantly, this did not only apply to retail prices (in the formation of which network costs and taxes play a key role), but also to wholesale prices, the level of which is more illustrative of rents captured by gas producers and importers.

The risks of this strategy have been illustrated by the turmoil in the global gas market caused by the sharp reduction in Russian pipeline gas exports to Europe. The UK, with its ample LNG import facilities, has not been short of gas and indeed has even acted as a land-bridge to continental Europe via its interconnectors, but it has suffered from high prices and the risks associated with increased global competition in a tight market. This report, written by Marshall Hall, who is a Senior Research Fellow at OIES, addresses the challenges that this new environment poses and provides recommendations on policy and regulation that can help to provide greater flexibility and security in a gas market where the need to secure supply over the longer term can be hampered by market design and by the risks inherent in the energy transition.

One key question will be the ability of governments to pay rising subsidies when LNG imports grow and/or LNG prices rise again. Alternatively, when subsidies are removed, the ability of customers to pay higher prices is questionable. For several existing and aspiring LNG countries, coal and renewable energy sources, especially solar that showcases constantly declining deployment costs, are major competitors of new LNG-to-power projects.

Elsewhere, imports into Turkey rose by 1 Bcm and imports into the rest of the world (taken together) grew by approximately 0.6 Bcm (see Figure 5).

Overall, the end sales therefore amounted to almost 57 G(m3), with a decline of 2 G(m3) compared to 2017. To have a comparable figure with the final gas consumption data published by the Ministry of Economic Development mentioned above, we must however consider the volumes related to self-consumption, equal to 14.5 G(m3), that bring the value of overall consumption given by the Annual Survey to 71.4 G(m3), i.e. to a value comparable to the 70.3 G(m3) reported by the Ministry. The two sources classify the volumes of gas handled over the year in different ways. Unlike more recent years, in 2018 self-consumption also showed a fairly substantial reduction, equal to 3.7% in terms of volumes. This item has a very strong influence in electricity generation (in fact, 87.5% of self-consumption falls within this sector). The decline of final consumption, which emerges both from the data of the annual survey (-5.1%), and the data from the Ministry, though to a lesser extent (-3.2%), appears to be tied to a more substantial downsizing of the productive sectors (and more precisely thermoelectric), compared to that of civil consumption.","NRA Report","Italy",2019-01-01,0,2019,NA,26036,"Market Data","Regulators","Southern Europe",NA,0,FALSE,"other"

In 2020, the gap widened significantly compared to the previous year, rising to 22%, as a result of the different evolution of the two markets: while in the standard offer service there was a drop in price of 16%, in the free market the decrease was limited to 5%; this is easily attributable to the fact that, as the free market features mainly fixed price contracts for a predetermined period, it transferred the sharp drop in prices in the wholesale markets to a lesser extent to end customers.

Much of this debate arises from the exponential growth of the fracking industry in the U.S. (see box 2), which has been surrounded by controversy about the environmental, social and health impacts, analysed largely thanks to an unprecedented effort from the scientific community.27 The question of the volume of methane leakage at various stages of the gas life-cycle (extraction, treatment, distribution and consumption) has become an important subject of (still) ongoing academic research, and of heated political debate. Dozens of peer-reviewed studies have already been published on the subject, documenting many actual and potential sources of methane leaks.28 Although the presence of super-emitters (i.e. wells with very high levels of methane emissions) and a lack of maintenance and monitoring of abandoned wells make overall estimates of methane emissions difficult to assess, recent estimates of U.S. gas industry emissions have shown rates 50 to 60% higher than official numbers published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).29 As noted by Anderson and Broderick, recent empirical studies on fossil fuel producing areas have found official emissions inventories reported by governments to be underestimates of the areas surveyed.30 While the U.S. EPA has not aligned its official figures with these scientific findings, it has started to acknowledge the problem by publicly admitting that methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and gas sector are substantially higher than we previously understood (Gina McCarthy, U.S. EPA Administrator, February 2016).31 At the end of 2016, new rules were designed by the Obama Administration in the U.S. to cut methane emissions from federal oil and gas operations. While far from perfect,32 they aimed to reduce these emissions by 40 to 45% by 2025.33 But these rules may never see the light of day; the Trump Administration has already delayed their implementation34 (a decision warmly welcomed by the gas industry35), and is now trying to repeal them completely.36  The growth of high-volume hydraulic fracturing or fracking to extract oil and gas from underground rock, often shale, formations has led to the U.S. increasing its gas production by 50% since 200537 .

For instance, a decision of the German government to reduce the role of coal power stations in the electricity sector would reduce the flow of coal through the Netherlands substantially. At the same time, a decision by Dutch authorities to withdraw the license to import and transit coal through the Netherlands would greatly impact the German electricity sector. They would have to find a different harbour through which to import coal and would not be able to use river barges to supply their power plants. Also, the stimulation of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in NW Europe could change the flow of oil and oil products through the Netherlands. Depending on the competitive position of the various refineries, it could have different outcomes. Restructuring of the German refineries could potentially lead to an increase in oil product exports to Germany. However, if competitive German refineries capture a larger share of the shrinking market for transport fuels, oil product exports from the Netherlands to Germany could decrease. Another option is that European refiners will export more refined product to international markets, i.e. to markets outside Europe, to compensate for the shrinking market at home.","Clingendael","Report",2018-02-01,1,2018,"Europe's Energy Relations.json",5026,"Netherlands & Groningen","Thinktanks","Other",NA,0,FALSE,"realist_framework"

Without major changes in the European supply and demand balance, European hub prices followed Asian spot prices in their descent. The TTF tumbled from a historical high of 29 EUR/MWh in December 2013 to a four-year low of 16.6 EUR/Mwh in July 2014. Oil prices only started to decrease in June  leading to the expectation of declining oil-indexed prices in early 2015  and collapsed at the end of the year, reaching 58 $/bbl in December. When oil prices started to decline, European hub prices recovered  marking a temporary but significant decorrelation between the two. Russian contract prices in Germany, Italy and Central-Eastern Europe followed NBP and TTF prices, confirming that significant elements of hub indexation had been introduced by then. However, contract prices trailed hub prices with a time lag of approximately two months and bottomed at a higher level (albeit with a much smaller gap than in 2009). Finally, when LNG prices rallied in winter, in line with seasonal dynamics, the expectation of falling oil indexed prices put a cap on LNG spot price recovery. In fact, LNG buyers reduce their offtake in anticipation of falling oil-indexed prices, thereby increasing the availability of flexible LNG on spot markets and compounding the downward trajectory of hub prices.772 In spite of low prices, and narrowing differentials with Asia, Europe did not import significantly larger volumes of LNG. The lower prices did not help gas consumption in Europe, as coal and CO2 prices were still too low to trigger switching in the power sector.

The inheritance of plentiful supplies of cheap gas at a handful of prolific supergiant fields developed in the Soviet times allowed first the Soviet and then the Russian government to expand the share of natural gas in Russias energy balance and simultaneously keep gas prices at home systematically low. This Soviet policy continued in Russia during the 1990s and early 2000s. There were three general reasons for that: macroeconomic considerations, industrial policy reasoning, and strategy of transition. First, reining in cost-push inflationary factors, such as gas price hikes, served as a supporting instrument for the government in its general anti-inflationary policy. Second, this was meant to shield the energy-inefficient Russian economy, which lacked funds for investment and modernization during and immediately after the difficult years of the 1990s.

Gas MRET accounts for about 3% of Russias federal budget revenues and represents 13% of overall MRET collections (for all mineral resources). For natural gas a single specific rate in rubles per thousand cubic metres existed in 2005-2011. Companies simply had to pay a fixed fee of 147 rubles/Mcm of natural gas produced (from $4.6 to $5.9/Mcm, depending on average annual exchange rates). The rate was set at a relatively low level reflecting low regulated domestic gas prices in Russia. After a series of regulated gas price hikes in Russia during 2005-2010, the effective tax take from gas MRET fell almost two-fold as a percentage of domestic gas sales revenue. The Russian government realized it was shying away from significant rents and decided to act. As Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Shatalov put it at the time, regulated gas price hikes were going to give gas producers additional windfall revenues that they did not earn, so they needed to return to the state its fair share of the run-up (Shatalov, 2012). There were two annual gas MRET rate hikes in 2012 and 2013 along with the introduction of two tiers: a higher one applied to Gazprom and a lower one - to independent gas producers (IGPs). The corresponding rates in 2013 were 622 and 402 rubles ($19.5 and $12.6)/Mcm.

We attempt to unpack the problem and evaluate its components, such as the potential for growth in Russias domestic gas market, the scheduled ramp up of gas exports to China under the existing SPAs, and whether additional Russian gas molecules could find their way to southern Europe via Turkey (stripped of their title of origin in the process).","OIES",NA,2023-01-01,0,2023,"â€œCatch 2022â€ for Russian gas plenty of capacity amid disappearing market",51215,"Turkey Azerbaijan SGC","Thinktanks","Other",NA,1,FALSE,"realist_instruments"

This prompted the EC to develop its own  simplified (using only two indicators)  temporary CBA methodology, which was used for assessment, with significantly less time available for consultation. In addition, the PCI/PMI selection process was undermined by the late submission of ENTSOGs TYNDP 2022, including its project-specific CBA results, in September 2023. (Normally, the TYNDP would have to be finalized and available at the time of the submission of candidate PCI/PMI projects and at the time of the provision of NRAs assessment, so that it would inform and guide a PCI/PMI selection process.) As a result, ACER was unable to assess consistent application of the CBA to all the candidate hydrogen PCI/PMIs because of unavailability of the project-specific CBA results for the candidate projects as part of the TYNDP 2022, lack of transparency in the results from applying the PCI/PMI selection methodology, and inability of the majority of Member States NRAs to scrutinize the candidate projects. Consequently, these projects were made part of the TYNDP 2022 without ENTSOGs CBA assessment and part of the regional PCI/PMI lists with only a relatively light-touch assessment, based on significantly simplified EC CBA methodology, and with only a limited regulatory oversight and scrutiny.

Naftogaz has since invited Gazprom to re-negotiate the contracts terms to bring tariffs into conformity with new methodology, thus potentially resulting in (at least) a 50% increase. 183 The Ukrainian energy minister, Volodimyr Demchyshin, has since acknowledged that Naftogaz has no legal grounds for charging Gazprom tariffs in line with new methodology until a new transit contract is signed, and will not do so. 184 Although Gazprom is unlikely to agree to changes in tariffs prior to expiry of the existing contract at the end of 2019, the issue cannot be avoided in any negotiation of a post-2019 transit contract and is likely to become contentious: Gazprom has said that it will resist changes disadvantageous to it commercially, and projected that new tariffs calculated in this way would be significantly higher than on other transit routes. 185","OIES",NA,2016-02-01,0.908801826177667,2016,"Russian Gas Transit Across Ukraine Post-2019 â€“ pipeline scenarios, gas flow consequences, and regulatory constraints",38347,"Ukrainian Transit","Thinktanks","Other",NA,0,FALSE,"realist_instruments"

Given that TOP quantities (are understood to) have been reduced to 70% of ACQ and given that Russian gas exports to Europe in 2020 are not likely to be significantly higher (and might be lower) than they were under LTSCs in 2014 (150 bcm), even under scenarios envisaging no new pipelines by 2020, Gazprom would only be short of some 6.6-23.6 bcm of capacity necessary for meeting its minimum TOP obligations without having to use the Ukrainian transit corridor (depending on whether or not the OPAL cap is lifted). Thus Gazprom would need to conclude a medium-term transit contract with the Ukrainian TSO to transit at least 6.623.6 bcma of gas during 2020-25 (thus matching Gazproms LTSC time profile). As far as volumes in excess of TOP obligations are concerned (~34 bcm and potentially up to maximum nominations), Gazprom might want to continue using the Ukrainian corridor for deliveries above TOP levels, given that a failure to deliver these volumes would result in penalties and lost revenues. In this case, Gazprom would need to conclude new post-2019 short-term transit contracts (i.e. less than 1 year) with the Ukrainian TSO. All of this would necessitate Gazproms continued usage of the Ukrainian corridor, with the most likely overall range of 40-60 bcm (i.e. effectively at the 2014 level) but possibly higher at 60-75 bcm.","OIES",NA,2016-02-01,0,2016,"Russian Gas Transit Across Ukraine Post-2019 â€“ pipeline scenarios, gas flow consequences, and regulatory constraints",38373,"Ukrainian Transit","Thinktanks","Other",NA,0,FALSE,"realist_instruments"

This is most critical in the case of the Russia-China negotiations regarding a new 50 bcma contract. The Chinese seem to be under no time pressure to negotiate, while Russia is sitting on a time bomb, facing a potential sharp reduction in gas export volumes, and wary of the fact that the counterbalancing effect on export revenues from todays high gas prices is likely to start dissipating in the next few years. A second point to make is that all three ideas are second-best options compared to the lost Gazprom sales to Europe. It should not be surprising to anyone that China, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are likely to exploit their new negotiating leverage to secure significant price discounts and other concessions from Gazprom, which will ultimately reduce the Russian companys sales margin. A third and final point is that Russia has two, maximum three years to address the weak links in its gas export strategy. If solutions are not found, the risks of very negative developments on the export revenue side will become apparent, potentially forcing Russia to devalue the rouble further and hike domestic gas prices in order to be able to increase the state tax take, ultimately reducing Russias macro-economic stability and shattering the historic social contract around gas supply to the domestic market.","OIES",NA,2024-03-01,0,2024,"Outlook for Russiaâ€™s oil and gas production and exports",53719,"Gazprom","Thinktanks","Other",NA,1,TRUE,"realist_objectives"

Most of the emissions reductions will result from changes in Shells products portfolio after 2030.
